# Udacity's Front End Final Project: Neighborhood Map

The aim of this project is to create a single webpage using the Google Maps API, as well as at least one other
API of choice.

## Running The App

Clone the app via:

`$ git clone https://github.com/asherem/udacity-final-project`

Click on the folder, and open `index.html` to view the page.

## What's Inside

Besides this `README.md`, you will find a `js.js`, `index.html`, and `styles.css`. These are the only 3 files
necessary to successfully run the app. All other scripts are imported, from markers to animations, and
more complex stylings are pure CSS via [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover).

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the Udacity Discussion forums, Stack Overflow, Hover.css, and GitHub for ideas, snippets, and
suggestions.
